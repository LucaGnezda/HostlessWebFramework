# A Hostless Web Framework - An educational codebase structure to have fun with
## About
This repo is a serverless coding framework, with everything you need to start, all in a single bundle.

What is a hostless web framework? I'm glad you asked. It is an HTML codebase that can be run in a browser straight from a filesystem, without any need for build actions or web hosting. I did this as a way of providing my nephews a fully formed framework, without the need for any of the usual the commercial development complexities. This presents several challenges, namely:
- There is no way to do package imports or dynamic loading of files (without user drag user initiated uploads)
- Without packages and builds ... this means no TypeScript, Angular, ... (so everything has to be built from first principles)

But it does actually come with some of the niceties you'd hope for, such as:
- Compartmentalisation of View, Logic and Data
- Observable objects
- Improved logging
- etc.

## How to run
This bit is easy ... and kind of cool.
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open index.html in your Browser.
3. Start coding!

## Hang on a sec, but where do I begin?
Ok, I'd actually start by:
1. Cloning the DDD Presentation I gave in 2024 and run that index.html. It shows how everything is put together, and the story behind it. 
2. Read the following:
    - This readme
    - The 6 readmes in the ./app folder
3. Go back to the DDD presentation and look at how it did things for inspiration.
4. Start your own project

## And most importantly of all...
Coding is and should be fun ... if using this framework doesn't feel like fun, stop and try something else to help you learn coding.

As Eric Curtis says ... "Go make a thing."

Best of luck padawan.
